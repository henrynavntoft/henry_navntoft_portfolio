        "During my third semester at KEA, we collaborated with Charlie Tango on a case for the real estate company EDC, utilizing Next.js. The objective of this case was to assist individuals contemplating selling their property (the seller) in acquiring insights about the market prior to collaborating with a real estate agent. By doing so, they would gain an understanding of their properties value and prospective buyers within their vicinity before initiating the process or partnering with an agent.",
